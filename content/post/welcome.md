Welcome to my blog. Here I'll be writing about a variety of tech and business-related topics as I try to explore, experiment, and learn some new skills.

I've been working in computer security since mid-2000, but due to the nature of the work, I have unfortunately published little-to-nothing in the public sphere. As part of a plan to do more "giving back," I'm starting this blog, and (hopefully) putting out some interesting open-source tools and articles.

That's all for now, thanks for visiting.
