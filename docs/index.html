<h2 id="where-to-find-more-execution-performance">Where to Find More Execution Performance</h2>

<p>Moore&rsquo;s Law <a href="http://fortune.com/2017/01/05/intel-ces-2017-moore-law/">is just about done</a>. It once described a trend of transistor count doubling every 24 months (enabled by increasing the density of transistors by making them ever-smaller). Now:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Between the introduction of 65 nm and 45 nm chips, about 23 months passed. To get from 45 nm to 32 nm took about 27 months, 28 months to go down from there to 22 nm and 30 months to shrink to the current 14 nm process. And that&rsquo;s where Intel has been stuck since September 2014.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Intel <em>might</em> release 10nm scale chips in late 2017, which would mean that they worked 36-40 months in order to shrink from 14nm to 10nm scale. In other words, the most recent density doubling (the shrink from 22nm to 10nm), by the time it happens, will have taken over 5 years. The next doubling is likely to take at least that long, assuming the multiple breakthroughs required to do so can even be achieved. 10nm is already fairly close to the atomic scale: ~45 silicon <em>atoms</em> across (one atom: 0.22nm). One of the obstacles at this scale to be addressed is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_tunnelling">quantum tunneling</a>, not that I pretend to understand it.</p>

<p>Of course, Moore&rsquo;s Law can be satisfied one other way without changing density, which is to simply use bigger and bigger processor dies. You may have seen charts showing that transistor <em>count</em> continues to increase on schedule with Moore&rsquo;s Law, but this is only true for dedicated GPUs and high-end server CPUs, which are already up against cost practicality limits due to these die sizes.</p>

<p>Even if we were still on track for Moore&rsquo;s Law, increasing transistor counts alone have <a href="https://cartesianproduct.wordpress.com/2013/04/15/the-end-of-dennard-scaling/">provided diminishing returns as of late</a>. Recent density increases have mainly just served to reduce power draw and to make more space on the CPU die dedicated to graphics rendering (an ideal parallelizable task). Tech being an optimistic culture makes it slow to acknowledge the obvious truth here: CPU <em>cores</em> aren&rsquo;t getting significantly faster. Unless your work is on a mobile device or can be delegated to a GPU or server farm, your only performance upgrades since 2010 have been I/O-related ones.</p>

<p>Granted, transistor density improvements have continued to increase CPU power efficiency. But I have a Intel &ldquo;Core i7&rdquo; (2.66 GHz i7-620M, 2-core) laptop that will turn 7 years old in a couple of months, and today&rsquo;s equivalent CPUs <em>still</em> offer only a marginal performance improvement for tasks that aren&rsquo;t 3D graphics. The equivalent CPU today, the Intel &ldquo;Core i7&rdquo; (2.7GHz i7-7500U, 2-core), has single-threaded performance only about 60% better than my CPU from 7 years ago. Not enough to make me throw out my old laptop.</p>

<p>All of this background is to make my point, which is that the next performance leap has to come from improved software, rather than relying on &ldquo;free&rdquo; improvements from new hardware. A few software methods for achieving a generational improvement in performance might be:</p>

<ul>
<li>Parallelism</li>
<li>Optimizing compilers</li>
<li>Moving tasks from interpreted languages back to compiled languages</li>
</ul>

<p>All of these things are already happening, but it&rsquo;s the last one that I&rsquo;m interested in most.</p>

<h2 id="parallelism">Parallelism</h2>

<p>Parallelism has brought great performance improvements in graphics, &ldquo;AI,&rdquo; and large data set processing (so-called &ldquo;Big Data&rdquo;), and is the reason why GPUs <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor_count#GPUs">continue to march forward in transistor count</a> (although, again, check out those increasing die sizes; those are approaching their own limits of practicality). The problem with parallelism, though, is that while there are some workloads that are naturally suited to it, others aren&rsquo;t and never will be. Sometimes, computing Task B is dependent on the outcome of Task A, and there is just no way to split up Task A. Even when parts of a task <em>can</em> be parallelized, there are swiftly diminishing returns to adding more cores, as described <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amdahl%27s_law">by Amdahl&rsquo;s Law</a>. What parallelized processing <em>does</em> scale well for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gustafson%27s_law">is large data sets</a>, although the home user is not typically handling large data sets, and won&rsquo;t directly benefit from this kind of parallelism.</p>

<h2 id="optimizing-compilers">Optimizing Compilers</h2>

<p>Here are <a href="https://cr.yp.to/talks/2015.04.16/slides-djb-20150416-a4.pdf">Daniel J Bernstein&rsquo;s 2015 slides</a> about the death of &ldquo;optimizing compilers,&rdquo; or rather, that despite all the hype about them, we are still manually tuning the performance critical portions of our programs. The optimizing compilers&rsquo; optimization of non-critical code portions is irrelevant, or at least not worth the effort put into optimizing compilers. It appears that a compiler to generically optimize any code as well as an expert human could, would require something like a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence">general AI</a> with a full contextual understanding of the problem being solved by the code. Such a thing doesn&rsquo;t exist, and is not on the horizon.</p>

<h2 id="better-safer-compiled-languages">Better (Safer) Compiled Languages</h2>

<p>C and C++ never really left us, and neither have all of the inherent memory errors in code programmed in C and C++. That includes Java, whose runtime is still written in C. The Java runtime has been the source of many &ldquo;Java&rdquo; security issues over the years, to the point where the Java plug-in was effectively banned from all web browsers. Despite that, the rest of the browser is also written in C and C++, and just as prone to these problems. There hasn&rsquo;t been any viable alternative but to try to sandbox and privilege-reduce the browser, because any safer language is too slow.</p>

<p>The real cost of C and C++ &rsquo;s performance is their high maintenance burdens: coding in them means always opening up subtle concurrency errors, memory corruption bugs, and information leak vulnerabilities. This is why simply improving the C++ standard library and adding more and more features to the language has not altered its basic value proposition to developers, who have already fled to &ldquo;safe&rdquo; languages.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s where the experimental language, Rust, comes in. It&rsquo;s a compiled systems programming language with performance on par with (<a href="http://benchmarksgame.alioth.debian.org/u64q/which-programs-are-fastest.html">or better than</a>) C++, but with compile-time restrictions on memory management and concurrency that should prevent entire classes of bugs. At some point in the next 5 years, I predict that we will see Rust (or something like it, whether it&rsquo;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swift_(programming_language)">Swift</a> or some new really strict C++ compiler) slowly start replacing C/C++ wherever performance and security are both primary concerns. It&rsquo;s exciting to think that a well-designed compiled language could solve most of the reasons for the ~20-year flight away from native code programming.</p>

<p>Having played with Rust for a few days, I can say it will certainly not replace Python for <em>ease</em> of development, but it&rsquo;s a really interesting disruptor for anyone writing native code. Security researchers should also take notice.</p>

<h2 id="rust-programming-language">Rust Programming Language</h2>

<p>For what it&rsquo;s worth, Rust was the “Most Loved Programming Language of 2016 in the Stack Overflow Developer Survey.” It enforces memory management and safety at compile-time. Some memory safety features of the language include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Rust does not permit null pointers or dangling pointers. Since pointers are never NULL, you can always safely dereference a pointer.</li>
<li>There are no “void” pointers.</li>
<li>Pointers can not be downcast to a more specific type, only upcast to a more generic type. If generic data structures are needed, you use parameterized types/functions.</li>
<li>Variables can be allocated on the heap and are cleaned up without the need for “free” or “delete.”</li>
<li>There can be only one pointer pointing to an allocation, and it is passed back and forth between “owners” such that concurrent access race conditions are impossible. (*EDIT: <a href="https://twitter.com/vitiral">@vitiral</a> clarifies that while there can only be one <strong>mutable</strong> pointer, there can be infinite immutable references*)</li>
</ul>

<p>If you just wanted a statically typed, compiled language with a modern standard library that is easy to extend, you could also choose Go. But Rust claims to be all of that, plus faster and safer. Rust will work in embedded devices and other spaces currently occupied by C/C++; Go will not. <a href="http://yager.io/programming/go.html">Some think Rust is just fundamentally better</a>, but I am not qualified to judge that.</p>

<h3 id="rust-and-parallelism">Rust and parallelism</h3>

<p>Rust makes parallelization an integral part of the language, with support for all of the necessary parallel programming primitives. Parallelized versions of various programming constructs can be swapped in without changing your existing code. This is possible because the Rust language forces the programmer to specify more about how data will be used, which prevents race conditions at runtime by turning them into errors at compile time, instead.</p>

<h3 id="concept-of-ownership-in-rust">Concept of &ldquo;Ownership&rdquo; in Rust</h3>

<p>The major innovation of the Rust language (inspired by a prior language, &ldquo;Cyclone&rdquo;) is that its compiler, in order to do memory management and prevent race conditions at compile time, tracks &ldquo;ownership&rdquo; of all variables in the code. Once a variable is used (like in a call to a function) it is considered to be passed to a new &ldquo;owner,&rdquo; and using it in a subsequent statement is illegal and would trigger a compiler error. If the developer&rsquo;s intention was to copy-on-use (&ldquo;clone&rdquo;), they must specify that in their code. For certain simple data types (integers, etc.), they are automatically copied-on-use without any explicit intent from the developer. Another aspect of ownership in Rust is that all variables are (what in C/C++ would be called) <code>const</code>, by default. In Rust, if you want a variable to be mutable, it has to be explicitly stated in the declaration.</p>

<p>This concept is the foundation of the Rust language. It&rsquo;s hard to grasp at first, since it is very different from programming in C or C++, or even Java. The most detailed explanation of Rust ownership that I&rsquo;ve seen is <a href="https://chrismorgan.info/blog/rust-ownership-the-hard-way.html">this article by Chris Morgan</a>, but to actually learn the concept I&rsquo;d recommend starting with <a href="http://intorust.com/tutorial/ownership/">this 25 minute video by Nikolas Matsakis</a>.</p>

<p>At first, it seems like another mental burden on the programmer, but adopting this concept of memory management means the programmer is also <em>relieved</em> of having to manage memory with carefully paired calls to <code>malloc()</code> and <code>free()</code> (or <code>new</code> and <code>delete</code>). &ldquo;So what, isn&rsquo;t this what you get with C# or Java?&rdquo; Not quite: those languages use a Garbage Collector to track references to data at <em>runtime</em>, which has an inherent performance overhead and whose &ldquo;stop-the-world&rdquo; resource management can be <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16695874/why-does-the-jvm-full-gc-need-to-stop-the-world">inconsistent and unpredictable</a>. Rust does it in the language, at compile time. <em>So, without the use of a Garbage Collector, Rust makes memory management (and concurrent access to data) safe again.</em></p>

<h3 id="rust-is-a-drop-in-replacement-for-c">Rust is a Drop-In Replacement for C</h3>

<p>Just like C/C++, Rust can <a href="https://blog.sentry.io/2016/10/19/fixing-python-performance-with-rust">be coupled to Python or any other language with a native interface, in order to leverage the strengths of both</a>. And, debugging Rust programs is officially <a href="https://www.mail-archive.com/info-gnu@gnu.org/msg02192.html">supported by GDB</a>. This works the other way around too, i.e., you can build a Rust program on top of native code libraries written in C/C++. Mozilla is even working on <a href="https://servo.org">a web browser engine in Rust</a>, to replace Gecko, the Firefox engine. <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&amp;px=MTgzNDA">Benchmarks in 2014</a> showed a 300% increase in performance vs Gecko, and by early 2016, it was <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&amp;px=Google-Servo-Perf-Comparison">beating Webkit and Chrome as well</a> (at least in some hand-picked benchmarks where they leverage Rust&rsquo;s ease of parallelism to delegate a bunch of stuff to the GPU). If you&rsquo;re interested in the details of how Rust can improve browser engines, Mozilla <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1505.07383v1.pdf">wrote about it here</a>. Buried in the paper is a detail that they seem to have downplayed elsewhere, though: the new browser engine is actually still bootstrapped by an existing codebase, so it&rsquo;s still 75% C/C++ code. On the other hand, that also goes to show how Rust integrates well with C/C++.</p>

<h3 id="rust-has-a-package-manager-which-is-also-its-build-tool">Rust has a Package Manager, which is also its Build Tool</h3>

<p>Makefiles are impossible to write and debug, and basically you&rsquo;re always just copy-pasting a previous Makefile into the new one, or hoping an IDE or build tool abstracts away all that crap for you, which is why <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_build_automation_software">this wheel has been reinvented many times</a>. I generally don&rsquo;t have a favorite build tool (they&rsquo;re all bad), since it always seems to come down to a manual troubleshooting cycle of acquiring all the right dependencies. The worst is having a build system that is a big layer cake of scripts on top of XML on top of Makefiles.</p>

<p>Rust package manager &ldquo;Cargo&rdquo; simply uses TOML files to describe what a Rust project needs in order to build, and when you build with Cargo, it just goes out and gets those dependencies for you. Plus, the packages are served from Crates.io, so if you&rsquo;re keeping score that&rsquo;s a double tech hipster bonus for using both the .io domain <em>and</em> TOML.</p>

<h2 id="installation-and-hello-world">Installation and Hello World</h2>

<p>Assuming you&rsquo;re using MacOS like me (there is plenty of info out there already for Windows and Linux users) and you have Homebrew:</p>

<pre><code class="language-sh">    $ brew install rust
    $ rustc --version
    rustc 1.15.0
</code></pre>

<p>You probably want an editor with Rust syntax highlighting and code completion. <a href="https://areweideyet.com">These are your choices</a>. I went with Visual Studio Code, aka VS Code. It&rsquo;s not what I&rsquo;d call an IDE, and I still haven&rsquo;t gotten it to integrate with a debugger, but hopefully JetBrains will step up and make a Rust IDE – once there is a market for it.</p>

<p>VS Code doesn&rsquo;t understand Rust out of the box. Launching VS Code, hit Command-P to open the in-app console:</p>

<pre><code>ext install vscode-rust
(install the top search result, should be the extension by kalitaalexey)
</code></pre>

<p>Optionally, you can install a GDB/LLDB integration layer to attempt to debug from VS Code (in theory – YMMV but I haven&rsquo;t gotten it to work for LLDB with C++ yet, let alone Rust):</p>

<pre><code>ext install webfreak.debug
(install the top search result)
</code></pre>

<p>Notice in the bottom right: “Rust tools are missing” … click install. It will invoke Cargo (the Rust package manager) to download, compile, and install more of the Rust toolchain for you: racer, rustfmt, rustsym, etc. And all of the dependencies for those. Go have a coffee, this will take a while. About 18 minutes on my system.</p>

<p>Finally: close VS Code, and open up Terminal so we can put all these new Rust binaries on your $PATH.</p>

<pre><code>$ open -a /Applications/TextEdit.app ~/.bash_profile
</code></pre>

<p>Add the line <code>export PATH=&quot;/Users/yourusername/.cargo/bin:$PATH&quot;</code> and save.</p>

<p>Open a new instance of VS Code. It should no longer tell you that Rust tools are missing. 👍🏻</p>

<p>Test the environment with a Hello World in Rust! Save the following as hello.rs:</p>

<pre><code class="language-rust">fn main() {
    println!(&quot;Hello World!&quot;);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Open &ldquo;View -&gt; Integrated Terminal.&rdquo; From here you can compile by hand like a peasant, because VS Code isn’t an actual IDE.</p>

<pre><code class="language-sh">bash-3.2$ cd ~/Desktop
bash-3.2$ rustc hello.rs
bash-3.2$ ./hello
Hello World!
</code></pre>

<p>But for a realistic scenario, we could have also used Cargo to both create a new Rust project and then build it.</p>

<p>In a future post, I will share my thoughts on what it&rsquo;s like to try to actually write a program in Rust.</p>

<p>Whether you&rsquo;re just starting work for a business that does federal contracting, or if you&rsquo;ve been doing it for a long time, you know that the contracting and administrative side of the business speaks its own language. Mostly this is the language of <em>federal acquisition</em>. <em>Acquisition</em>, here, refers to the process of the government acquiring a product or service from the private sector – also known as procurement. It is defined and codified by Congress in a regulation called the Federal Acquisition Regulation (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Acquisition_Regulation">FAR</a>).</p>

<p>Jargon is nowhere near the hardest part of administrating or operating a successful contracting business, but it is one intimidating factor that can prevent the tech experts working for federal contractors from participating in the leadership roles at their company. So if you get familiar with the terminology of the bureaucracy, you can at least get that out of the way and focus on the difficult parts, like the business plan and the customer relationships. In my experience, those who&rsquo;ve mastered and understood these concepts seem to have no interest in sharing their knowledge. It&rsquo;s almost as if keeping the technical staff in the dark about the administrative functions is what justifies the rigid boss/employee dichotomy.</p>

<h2 id="codes-that-register-a-business-with-the-government">Codes that Register A Business with the Government</h2>

<h4 id="duns-number">DUNS Number</h4>

<p>A credit bureau for businesses known as Dun &amp; Bradstreet assigns these unique nine-digit identifiers. A DUNS number is used to establish a business credit file, which is often referenced by lenders and potential business partners to help predict the reliability and/or financial stability of the company in question. DUNS stands for &ldquo;Data Universal Numbering System&rdquo; but really it&rsquo;s just a convenient backronym to incorporate the law firm&rsquo;s name. You have to have a DUNS number to bid for federal government contracts. It&rsquo;s free to obtain one, unless you want it expedited.</p>

<h4 id="ein-employer-identification-number">EIN: Employer Identification Number</h4>

<p>When you register a company with the IRS for tax-filing purposes, you receive one of these EINs. If you&rsquo;ve ever received a W-2 statement as an employee, you&rsquo;ve seen that the EIN for your employer is on the form.</p>

<h4 id="sam-system-for-award-management-cage-code">SAM: System for Award Management / CAGE Code</h4>

<p>SAM is a fairly new system that replaces several redundant systems that existed previously. Any company that would like to do business with the federal government, or needs to report subcontract information, must register on the System for Award Management (SAM). So after you have an EIN and a DUNS, you can go to the SAM and register, after which you will receive a CAGE Code (Commercial and Government Entity). This is yet another unique identifier for your business, required for any company that does federal contracting. Applying for a CAGE code also requires knowing your NAICS code (see below) that categorizes what your business does. A company&rsquo;s SAM status has to renewed every year, but at least there&rsquo;s no fee.</p>

<h4 id="dsbs-dynamic-small-business-search">DSBS: Dynamic Small Business Search</h4>

<p>Optional and for small businesses only: there&rsquo;s an additional system to be found by government procurement officers, called the <a href="http://dsbs.sba.gov/dsbs/search/dsp_dsbs.cfm">DSBS</a>. When registering with the SAM system, you can also create a DSBS profile through there.</p>

<h2 id="codes-that-categorize-product-service-offerings">Codes that Categorize Product &amp; Service Offerings</h2>

<p>In an attempt to standardize purchases, government has come up with multiple (redundant) classification codes. In other words, they&rsquo;ve attempted to create a taxonomy of commoditized goods and services. Like with all taxonomic follies, the inherent assumption here is that all offerings from businesses can <em>be</em> classified as this or that, or that the whole exercise is useful for anything. In this case, it is supposed to assist government buyers in finding sellers (although this is not really how they find sellers) and it is might assist sellers in determining who is buying a particular thing (although that too does not really work in practice). The more specialized and hi-tech your offering, the less useful it is to try to fit it into a code classification.</p>

<p>So, choosing your own category codes is dicey, and you should not choose them based purely on your own judgment, but rather what your intended customers are purchasing. If you do some reconnaissance on public databases of past contracts, you can check what codes your competitors have used. Those are probably the ones you will use as well.</p>

<h4 id="naics-codes-http-www-naics-com"><a href="http://www.naics.com/">NAICS Codes</a></h4>

<p>There are over 1200 of these <em>North American Industrial Classification System</em> codes, defined by the Census Bureau or possibly the Office of Management and Budget. This is the categorical bin you&rsquo;re placing your business in. You&rsquo;d choose it <em>based on a careful review of what code your customer buys</em>, not which one <em>you</em> think is most appropriate.</p>

<h4 id="psc-product-service-codes-http-support-outreachsystems-com-resources-tables-pscs"><a href="http://support.outreachsystems.com/resources/tables/pscs/">PSC: Product Service Codes</a></h4>

<p>These are similar to NAICS codes, but as a categorical bin for the product or service being sold, as opposed to your business itself. There are even more of these: roughly 2300. They are <a href="https://www.acquisition.gov/service_product_codes.pdf">defined by the GSA</a>.</p>

<p>Use these codes for research: find bidding opportunities on <a href="https://www.fbo.gov">FedBizOpps,</a> or find past contracts on the Federal Procurement Data System (and the agencies that awarded them). You can also find your competition: the Dynamic Small Business Search, enter in your NAICS or PSC codes.</p>

<h4 id="nigp-codes-http-nigp-com"><a href="http://nigp.com">NIGP Codes</a></h4>

<p>NIGP stands for The National Institute of Governmental Purchasing, but it&rsquo;s just another code for categorizing products and services. This one predates NAICS, and is only relevant at the state and local levels, so we&rsquo;ll ignore it here.</p>

<h2 id="the-gsa-schedule">The GSA Schedule</h2>

<p>GSA is the General Services Administration. The &ldquo;GSA Schedule&rdquo; is like a collection of pre-negotiated prices, sort of an accelerated buying process for commodity goods and services, where the focus is <em>price</em>. The term itself is a little misleading, as there are actually 39 GSA Schedules categorized by products and services, like schedule 70: IT Services.</p>

<p>It requires a cumbersome application process that asks you to provide several years of past-performance, and a commitment to sell at least $25k/year of goods or services through this contracting vehicle. <em>Being on the GSA Schedule seems might be a competitive edge for mid-size or larger businesses. But as a small business you&rsquo;d probably just subcontract to one of the 20,000 businesses that are on the GSA Schedule.</em></p>

<h4 id="sin-special-item-number">SIN: Special Item Number</h4>

<p>Under a particular GSA schedule, there may be subcategories for more specific goods or services. These are identified by SINs, another GSA-provided identifier. So if you are on Schedule 70 (IT) you might be selling a service under the Cloud SIN (132-40) that applies to cloud services, or if you&rsquo;re just consulting maybe you&rsquo;d use the broad &ldquo;IT Professional Services&rdquo; SIN (132-51). As of October 2016 <a href="https://interact.gsa.gov/document/gsa-it-schedule-70-incorporate-highly-adaptive-cybersecurity-services-sins">there are even a few SINs for cybersecurity services</a>.</p>

<h2 id="small-business-set-asides">Small Business Set-Asides</h2>

<p>The federal government has a mandate to deliver 23% of its prime contracts to small businesses. Just being a small business means there are opportunities marked for you, but many entrepreneurs also look to certify under an officially recognized disadvantaged status so that they bid for even more exclusive &ldquo;set-asides.&rdquo; Set-asides are federal contracts that restrict bidding to only members of certain qualifying groups. Not only that, but sometimes small businesses can receive sole-source contracts, also known as <em>no-bid</em> contracts.</p>

<p>The Small Business Administration (SBA) is an agency of the federal government set up to provide support to entrepreneurs and small businesses, through loan guarantees and these <a href="https://www.sba.gov/contracting/government-contracting-programs">special &ldquo;disadvantaged status&rdquo; programs</a>. The SBA defines most of the disadvantaged-status titles that you see attached to company profiles. &ldquo;Joe&rsquo;s Cyber Shop: a Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business.&rdquo; There&rsquo;s at least one other status, Veteran-Owned Small Business, that is certified by the Department of Veterans Affairs rather than the SBA.</p>

<h4 id="8-a-business-development-program">8(a) Business Development Program</h4>

<p>This program (named for a section of the Small Business Act) is for minority groups. An <a href="https://www.sba.gov/contracting/government-contracting-programs/8a-business-development-program/eligibility-requirements">eligible</a> business needs to apply for this status with the SBA, and be certified. Once certified, the SBA offers specialized business training, counseling, marketing assistance, and high-level executive development.</p>

<h4 id="hubzone">HUBZone</h4>

<p>Historically Underutilized Business Zones (HUBZones). If the company&rsquo;s principal office and 35% or more of its workforce resides in one of these zones, it can receive this other kind of preferential status. There&rsquo;s a <a href="http://map.sba.gov/hubzone/maps/">map of these zones</a> on the SBA site. No it isn&rsquo;t broken; it just really is that slow. Chances are these are not desirable places to move your headquarters <em>and</em> yourself to, solely for the chance that you might have an edge in competing for contracts. But even if you did relocate, you&rsquo;ll probably lose the status as soon as you make your first hire. You&rsquo;ll be competing for highly skilled individuals to work technical contracts, and you&rsquo;re just not going to find people like that living around a recently closed military base.</p>

<h2 id="procurement-terms">Procurement Terms</h2>

<p>There are a whole host of terms related to the government&rsquo;s offering of contract opportunities, and the contracting industry&rsquo;s pursuit of them. Quickly, here are some common ones:</p>

<ul>
<li>BAA: Broad Agency Announcement. This is how the government solicits for proposals for research and development (specifically). If the government agency is looking for specific products or services rather than basic and/or applied research, then they will issue an RFP instead of a BAA.</li>

<li><p>BD: Business Development. This is a pretty loosely-defined term. If used by an engineer, &ldquo;BD guy&rdquo; might be considered an insult. Sometimes BD is proposal-writing, sometimes it is relationship-buidling.</p></li>

<li><p>COTS: Commercial Off-The-Shelf. This is a term used to refer to anything that can be commercially purchased or is for sale to the general public. Also see GOTS.</p></li>

<li><p>FPDS: the Federal Procurement Data System. This is a database that is intended to be a single source for government-wide procurement data (information about awarded contracts). It&rsquo;s a reporting system. What I&rsquo;ve found is that not all contracts get reported here, so there must be some exceptions. You can use it to recon your competition, but perhaps don&rsquo;t rely on it too much.</p></li>

<li><p>GOTS: Government Off-The-Shelf. As opposed to COTS, something that is GOTS is not for sale to the general public, and typically is developed by the technical staff of one federal agency (or an outside source at their direction), for use by them and/or other government agencies. This is rare, compared to COTS.</p></li>

<li><p>GFP / GFE: Government Furnished Property / Equipment. Any time the government offers its own equipment in order for a contractor to perform a task, it is referred to as GFE. Technically, GFE is a kind of GFP. Another kind of GFP is GFM (Material). You may also see GFI (Information).</p></li>

<li><p>RFI: Request for Information. This is <em>not</em> a solicitation for proposals, it&rsquo;s much more preliminary than that. If the government needs more information in order to create a good RFP, then it will put out an RFI. Sometimes the desired response to an RFI is a Capabilities Request: the government occasionally wants to know the available contractors that can perform certain kinds of work. They may use an RFI as a process by which to accept a short (generally 5-10 pages) profile of your company&rsquo;s offerings and qualifications.</p></li>

<li><p>RFP: Request for Proposal. When the government knows its problem (<em>not</em> basic or applied research) but wants proposals with approaches and prices, then they put out an RFP.</p></li>

<li><p>SoW: Statement of Work. There are many formats and templates for what a SoW must include, but basically it is a list of obligations that the contractor states they will fulfill on the contract.</p></li>

<li><p>WBS: Work Breakdown Structure. This is project manager speak for the work that needs to get done, in outline form. That&rsquo;s it, it&rsquo;s an outline. But listen to this pretentious definition they teach in business school! &ldquo;A hierarchical decomposition of the total scope of work to be carried out by the project team to accomplish the project objectives and create the required deliverables.&rdquo;</p></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="contract-terms">Contract Terms</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ll make another blog post later about contract <em>types</em>, which is too much to cover here. But there are a few common terms to define up front, related to reading the contracts themselves:</p>

<ul>
<li>CDRL: Contract Data Requirements List. This might be specific to military contracts. Some might pronounce it &ldquo;see drill.&rdquo; It is a list of deliverables that the contractor is responsible for producing for the government. It is derived directly from the contractor&rsquo;s Statement of Work in their proposal.</li>
<li>CLIN: Contract Line Item Number. CLINs are specified in the FAR part 4.10. I think for the contractor, they are basically just numbers that identify deliverables. On the government side, it&rsquo;s part of an accounting and traceability system.</li>

<li><p>CO: Contracting Officer. This is the government person with the authority to enter into, make changes to, or terminate a govnerment contract. In other words, they have been delegated the authority to represent the government in the contracting process.</p></li>

<li><p>COR: Contracting Officer&rsquo;s Representative. This is a person who helps the CO administer the contract with the performer. The COR is not authorized to make any commitments or obligations on behalf of the government.</p></li>

<li><p>COTR: Contracting Officer&rsquo;s Technical Representative (COTR). A COTR is a particular <em>kind</em> of COR, designated by the CO to be their technical liason. It&rsquo;s often the case that the CO does not have a sufficient understanding of the specialized work being performed on the contract in order to accurately assess its progress, and this is when they appoint a COTR. Again, the COTR is not authorized to make any commitments or obligations on behalf of the government. Only the CO is.</p></li>
</ul>

                    <div class="post-description">
                        <p>The traditional model of entrepreneurship is:</p>

<ol>
<li>concept</li>
<li>plan</li>
<li>venture funding</li>
<li>exit</li>
</ol>

<p>It seems like most people just unquestioningly accept that this is the natural sequence of events, but why is it this way? Isn&rsquo;t there something missing from this? Like what about the focus on the customer, or about actually making a great service or product? If a business is working, why do you need to leave? What&rsquo;s the rush? Why do you immediately go from borrowing money to looking for a buyer? This sounds more like house flipping than entrepreneurship. Accepting venture capital funding means accepting their short-sighted outsider influence, and this is what creates the pressure for an exit (rather than the creation of a stable, sustainable business).</p>

<p>The frothy market of dollar-chasing VC-backed pump &amp; dump schemes is probably the worst way to try to generate a world-changing technological breakthrough. <em>We live in a world where every problem left worth solving is a difficult multi-disciplinary one that requires long-term-horizon thinking</em>. If you are just planning to make money, you may not care. If you are paying some lip service to making the world a better place, though, this seems like a case of some misaligned values.</p>

<p>What about the technical staff, in all of this? The scientists, engineers, programmers. They get left holding the bag on step 4, that&rsquo;s what. They get <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=rolled&amp;defid=175634">rolled</a>. At best, after &ldquo;exit,&rdquo; they have a new management team and a 5-10% retention bonus for a couple of years. More likely, everything they liked about the job culture goes out the window and they get to watch the 2 or 3 founders drive off in their new luxury sport sedans, with a cash cushion that makes them set for life. At worst, the technical staff will get laid off shortly after the acquisition and/or the business will implode.</p>

<p>Most people over the age of 25 have become wise to this trajectory of events. For tech labor, it&rsquo;s theoretically still a seller&rsquo;s market (seller, here, being the <em>employee</em> in the employee-employer relationship). So prospective employees naturally want to be paid not just a salary, but to actually feel like they are sitting at the table. High-value employees want to be cut in (to use another poker metaphor). If you as the employer <em>don&rsquo;t</em> cut them in, science has shown: <a href="http://esop.com/pdf/esopHistoryAndResearch/researchEvidence.pdf">you will be getting 5% less value out of them than you could be</a>, if you can even hire and retain them in the first place.</p>

<p>Offers of equity to new employees are exceedingly common in venture-capital startup land. But even in government land, it&rsquo;s not unheard of to work for a company with strong employee-ownership values. SAIC <a href="http://www.beyster.com/SAIC-Solution-Singh-Review.pdf">is (was, before its board took its stock public and then the model imploded) one well-known success story</a>, and in the early 2000&rsquo;s I worked for another <a href="https://www.parsons.com/markets/Pages/Sparta.aspx">lesser-known company</a> that used an identical compensation system (the founders of the two companies were friends, actually, and launched the companies in parallel). I have actually worked under a few different equity models over the years: a fully-employee-owned model (some in stock, some in NQO options), a profit-sharing &ldquo;equity&rdquo; model, and a no-equity model.</p>

<p>Business finance is not my specialty, but I believe that we as engineers should not adopt a learned helplessness. Many of us have a disinterest in the topic of money. Yes, equity compensation is complicated – even suspiciously so – and dry. Boring, even crass. But we should take an interest in ourselves, because nobody else will. Don&rsquo;t accept being exploited. This is about the empowerment of labor vs. capital.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/jlevy/og-equity-compensation">The Open Guide to Equity Compensation</a> is a community project to aggregate information to help improve the financial literacy of people in tech, specifically, to spread the kind of sophistication necessary to evaluate a compensation offer that is either all or partially made in terms of company equity. If you&rsquo;ve never read this guide, do so now! There is seriously good info there, and you may save yourself from making an expensive mistake.</p>

<p>The Open Guide still has a gap when it comes to LLCs, though, so I will add some wisdom from personal experience. If you plan on working at a small less-established or newly established LLC, and are considering an equity offer:</p>

<ul>
<li>know that LLCs&rsquo; equity sharing structure is different from Corporations, and advice on LLC equity is much harder to find, since LLCs are newer and less common than Corporations</li>
<li>the equity offer should be in writing, <em>signed</em></li>
<li>the offer should specify the award <em>and</em> vesting timeline. If an <em>option</em> award, it should specify the <em>award</em> <em>price</em></li>
<li>the offer should specify the <em>valuation method</em></li>
<li>the offer should be in <em>percentage</em> terms, not in terms of some malleable <em>unit</em> (fraction with an unknown denominator)</li>
<li>the offer should contain no loophole words like &ldquo;intend to,&rdquo; but be worded as a commitment, like &ldquo;shall&rdquo; or &ldquo;will&rdquo;</li>
<li>if the equity-sharing plan structure is still TBD, <em>consider the offer worthless</em></li>
</ul>

<p>Especially that last bullet, since it supercedes everything else. Once you accept the offer of employment, you lose all leverage. Once you have lost leverage, your &ldquo;equity&rdquo; (if you ever get it) will be defined as something worth nearly zero, in a way that most favors the company. Your <em>award</em> of, say, a defined percent of the valuation of the company can be interpreted to mean an <em>option</em> grant to <em>purchase</em> some equity. Remember, it&rsquo;s not an <em>award</em> if you have to <em>buy</em> it, it has no present value if you have to buy it at-or-above the present value when granted, and it&rsquo;s not <em>worth anything</em> if you can&rsquo;t sell it. Check: are you basically buying an illiquid asset with a tax consequence? Is this thing going to pay dividends until you can sell it? And for an LLC, also realize that you <em>might</em> have to give up employee (W-2) status and start paying more taxes on your salary, too.</p>

<p>See, with LLCs, you cannot get stocks, you can only get &ldquo;membership interest units.&rdquo; In an LLC, equity might be in the form of Profits Interest Units (not to be confused with <em>profit sharing</em>). &ldquo;Profit interest&rdquo; is a junior form of equity in every sense of the term – if you want the Big Boy equity (ownership) in an LLC you want &ldquo;Capital Interest.&rdquo; Either way though, unlike a stock, these two kinds of LLC Interests may be restricted in a way that prevents them from being freely transferred. You might have to hold it until the company itself is sold. And there are complicated consequences for taxation and accounting, that all threaten to make them more trouble than they are really worth, especially for small amounts.</p>

<p>Here is a table to help roughly compare LLC equity offers with traditional coporation equity offers.</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th align="left">Equity in a C- or S-Corporation</th>
<th align="left">Equity in a LLC (the closest parallel)</th>
</tr>
</thead>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td align="left">Stock Option</td>
<td align="left">Profits Interests Units <em>or</em> Options for Capital Interests</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td align="left">Restricted Stock Units (RSU)</td>
<td align="left">Capital Interests Units</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td align="left">&ldquo;Phantom Stock&rdquo;</td>
<td align="left">(Membership Interest) Unit Rights, a.k.a. &ldquo;Phantom Equity&rdquo;</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td align="left">Stock Appreciation Rights (SAR), a.k.a. Phantom Stock Option</td>
<td align="left">(Membership Interest) Unit Appreciation Rights</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p><strong>The more established an LLC company is, the less attractive a Profits Interest Unit becomes, relative to a Capital Interest Unit.</strong> That is because a Profits Interest value is only in the <em>future appreciation</em> of the value of the company, whereas a grant of Capital Interest is an immediate share of the value of the LLC as of the date that the interest is granted. In addition, the longer an employer can drag its feet and delay the award of a Profit Interest Unit, the less value it is to you. That&rsquo;s why award date, strike price, and vesting schedule are all very important.</p>

<p>If Amazon were an LLC, would you rather be granted – today – a 1% <a href="https://ycharts.com/companies/AMZN/profit_margin"><em>profit interest</em></a>? Or 1% <a href="https://ycharts.com/companies/AMZN/market_cap"><em>equity</em></a>? Amazon is infamously unprofitable, but also enormous. And if it were a profit interest, would you rather have that five years ago, or today? Five years ago obviously: even though Amazon is unprofitable, a PIU represents both profit and appreciation of company valuation, which for Amazon is like a 450% increase.</p>

<p>Also, keep in mind that an LLC can always allocate its gross profit in any given year so as to lower (or eliminate) net profit, disbursing the money in (almost) any way that it sees fit. The management team feels like paying all the profits out as bonuses this year? That comes at the expense of the PIU holders. A company car for the CEO? Sorry PIU holders. If you get a great PIU award and it&rsquo;s fully vested today, but tomorrow the LLC is sold? Sorry, there hasn&rsquo;t been any growth in the company value over that period, so your PIUs are worth zero.</p>

<p>Anyway, I hope this has been useful. If you disagree or think I am misinformed, I am open to discussions; find me on Twitter. I encourage everyone to educate themselves using multiple sources, and I don&rsquo;t claim to be an authority on this subject. In fact, here&rsquo;s a disclaimer.</p>

<p>As mentioned in my last post, I spent some time solving security challenges posted on HackCenter for the Enigma2017 conference. This one (obviously) was to exploit a buffer overflow vulnerability. It was meant to be relatively easy, but sometimes you don&rsquo;t realize the easiest approach first. I&rsquo;ll walk through not just the solution, but the things I tried that <em>didn&rsquo;t</em> work. It was a refresher course in exploitation for me – I&rsquo;ve spent many years on defense research and needed to brush up again. I know that this is a fast walkthrough, but I don&rsquo;t want to try to teach every concept here, since it is a rather basic exercise, and many others have already explained them elsewhere. If you&rsquo;re reading and would like clarification, feel free to hit me up on Twitter.</p>

<h2 id="the-challenge">The Challenge</h2>

<p>They provided a web shell (literally a terminal emulator in your browser, at HackCenter.com) to a Linux host, and they even gave some free shellcode, <code>\x31\xC0\xF7\xE9\x50\x68\x2F\x2F\x73\x68\x68\x2F\x62\x69\x6E\x89\xE3\x50\x68\x2D\x69\x69\x69\x89\xE6\x50\x56\x53\x89\xE1\xB0\x0B\xCD\x80</code>. You can disassemble this several ways, but a fast and easy way is <a href="https://alexaltea.github.io/capstone.js/">someone else&rsquo;s server running Capstone.js</a>. We observe that it is an <code>execve</code> syscall at the end, and apparently is running <code>/bin/sh</code> to provide a shell. We already <em>have</em> a shell, so there must be something different about this target process they want us to exploit.</p>

<p>Notice the permissions for the <code>overlowme</code> binary include the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Setuid">SUID access right flag</a>. When you run this binary, it runs as the user <code>hacksports</code>, who is the owner of <code>key</code> and can read it. The goal here is to run arbitrary code in this process and use it to read <code>key</code>. The given shellcode, executed by <code>overflowme</code>, would provide us a shell where we have the ability to read <code>key</code>.</p>

<p>Notice also the last command, which reads out the ASLR setting: 2. That means that we should expect the OS to randomize the layout of the program&rsquo;s memory when it runs (both text <em>and</em> data segments, is what 2 means).</p>

<p>What about the source code they&rsquo;re letting us see?</p>

<h2 id="the-vulnerability">The Vulnerability</h2>

<p>This is a stack-based buffer overflow in the sprintf() call. A fixed-length buffer, <code>buf[979]</code> takes a user input of unchecked (and unlimited) length, in the program&rsquo;s first command-line argument. Since <code>buf</code> is on the stack (as it is a local variable to the function <code>vuln</code>), this is a stack-based buffer overflow.</p>

<p>There are many, many guides out there that explain what happens when you overflow a stack-based buffer on a program that was compiled with absolutely no exploit mitigations: your input overwrites the saved return pointer (also on the stack), and the function epilogue&rsquo;s <code>RET</code> instruction transfers code execution to the address that is now part of the overflowed input. So, the attacker decides where execution will go: arbitrary code execution.</p>

<p>Proof of the vulnerability:</p>

<pre><code class="language-sh">$ ./overflowme `perl -e 'print &quot;\x30&quot;x982'`
</code></pre>

<p>or if you prefer Python:</p>

<pre><code class="language-sh">$ ./overflowme `python -c 'print &quot;\x30&quot;*982'`
</code></pre>

<h2 id="the-exploitation">The Exploitation</h2>

<p>Successful exploitation in a real-world scenario would require multiple prerequisite steps, but this is a simplified exploitaiton case. We just need to solve a few things.</p>

<ol>
<li>Determine the offset in the attack input at which it overwrites the stored return pointer. These bytes have to point to where execution should go.</li>
<li>In order to complete step 1, determine the address where execution should go.</li>
</ol>

<p>Let&rsquo;s start with the 2nd thing. Check the process memory map by launching it under GDB and using ProcFS:</p>

<pre><code>(gdb) start
(gdb) shell ps
# ... observe the PID of overflowme, it is 32687

</code></pre>

<p>The last memory range, <code>[stack]</code> is executable. You would not see this anymore these days, but this makes exploitation easier, it means shellcode in the buffer overflow input itself can run where it exists, directly. So we just need to check where the buffer is on the stack and put the address into the buffer and we&rsquo;re good to go?</p>

<p>Well hold on. Recall that we saw ASLR was enabled in the OS. Let&rsquo;s run it another time and see these maps again.</p>

<p>See that the stack is at a different address. The OS has applied ASLR to the data segments and the shared libraries for <code>libc</code> and <code>ld</code>. However, the entirety of the program binary itself has not moved. That is, apparently <code>overflowme</code> was not even compiled with support for ASLR. Cool!</p>

<p>Our shellcode is on the stack though, and the stack is one of the parts of memory that is moving around on every run. But that&rsquo;s what we need a pointer to! Our only hope, then, is to find an instruction somewhere in the static mappings that jumps execution back to the stack. <em>Note: here is where I tried a number of unnecessary and fruitless solutions, thinking about this like a modern exploit developer (ROP gadgets, trampolines, etc.). If you just want to read the solution, skip to the next section where I &ldquo;Phone a Friend.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>My goal was to find an &ldquo;instruction gadget&rdquo; within the static mapping that would effectively work as a <code>JMP ESP</code> or <code>CALL ESP</code>. Using <code>hexdump -C | grep FF</code> I looked for <code>FF E4</code> or <code>FF D4</code> sequences. This is an extremely crude way to do this, but keep in mind the binary is very small. Unfortunately, <em>because</em> it&rsquo;s so small, there was also no occurence of either byte sequence.</p>

<p>If any of the general-purpose registers at the time of the function return happen to also hold pointers to the stack range, then we could trampoline through a <code>JMP EAX/EBX/ECX/EDX</code> or <code>CALL EAX/EBX/ECX/EDX</code>, etc. So I also looked for any of these sequences. I found an <code>FF D0 (call EAX)</code>, and a <code>FF D2 (call EDX)</code>! Good, but do we control either of those registers? Check: <code>(gdb) info registers</code>:</p>

<pre><code>eax            0x0      0                         
ebx            0xffa5d5a0       -5909088
ecx            0xf7726878       -143497096
edx            0x0      0
…
esp            0xffa5d56c       0xffa5d56c
ebp            0xffa5d588       0xffa5d588 
</code></pre>

<p>annnnd no, they’re both 0x0 by the time the attacker gets control of <code>EIP</code>. But what&rsquo;s this, <code>EBX</code> points into the stack (verified by another look at the <code>/proc/PID/maps</code>):</p>

<pre><code>ffa3e000-ffa5f000 rwxp 00000000 00:00 0		[stack]  
</code></pre>

<p>But alas, poring over the hexdump of the static mappings in memory, there is no <code>CALL EBX (FF D3)</code> or <code>JMP EBX (FF E3)</code> gadgets! There&rsquo;s not even something more indirect, like a <code>PUSH EBX; RET (53 C3</code>).</p>

<p>Another idea was to try to jump to one of the <code>GOT</code> entries, but this is a tiny little toy binary! It doesn&rsquo;t import anything useful, as we see with <code>objdump -T</code>:</p>

<p>If there was a <code>system()</code> in here or something it would be a different story maybe, but as is, there are no useful standard library calls in this table.</p>

<p>The ROP approach to this has failed me.</p>

<h2 id="phoning-a-friend">Phoning a Friend</h2>

<p>At this point I called a smart friend of mine for a tip on how to jump the instruction pointer to this stupid shellcode on the stack. We discussed more advanced gadget-finding using Z3 solvers and all sorts of stuff, but ultimately the hints that stuck with me were:</p>

<ul>
<li>Duh, you can stack spray like it&rsquo;s 1992: just make your input 100KB, NOP-sled to the end where shellcode lies, and re-run the exploit until it works by chance (until the input happens to inhabit a range around the address we choose to put in the overflowed return pointer).</li>
<li>You can store an arbitrary amount of NOP-sled in an environment variable and it will all get located in the stack segment.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="making-it-work">Making It Work</h2>

<p>Okay, so I have a good idea of how to (messily and probabilistically) get a successful exploit. The only thing I skipped over earlier was determining exactly how many bytes offset into the attack input we need to place the pointer. The way you do this is to use an exploit pattern string, such as you can <a href="http://projects.jason-rush.com/tools/buffer-overflow-eip-offset-string-generator/">generate online here</a> or offline using <a href="https://github.com/Svenito/exploit-pattern/blob/master/pattern.py">various tools</a>, and then watch the value of <code>EIP</code> when the process crashes under GDB:</p>

<p>There is a new &ldquo;Jeopardy style&rdquo; security CTF web framework (CTF-as-a-Service?) called <a href="http://hackcenter.com/">HackCenter</a> that just debuted from For All Secure, the CMU-affiliated security startup known for <a href="https://www.defense.gov/News/Article/Article/906931/three-teams-earn-prizes-in-darpa-cyber-grand-challenge">winning last year&rsquo;s DARPA Cyber Grand Challenge Final Event</a> with their game-playing &ldquo;automated exploit generation&rdquo; system they called Mayhem CRS.

<p>We also get a web shell on hackcenter.com: literally an in-browser terminal emulator connected to the remote server (we do not have read access to the directory with &ldquo;flag&rdquo;), but for this problem we will just open our local Terminal app and poke around.</p>

<h2 id="anything-ecb-is-bad-mmmkay">Anything ECB is Bad Mmmkay</h2>

<p>Look at the source: basically, <code>&quot;agent &quot; + yourinput + &quot; wants to see &quot; + flag</code> is padded out to the next nearest AES block length (128 bits == 16 bytes) and then encrypted with AES-ECB using whatever the key is. Now, basically the first thing you learn about block ciphers is to never use the Electronic Code Book (ECB) mode. You&rsquo;ll see a photo of Tux the Linux mascot encrypted with AES-ECB and how you can still see the edges of the image in the encrypted version. But that&rsquo;s about it. It&rsquo;s rare to see an explanation of why this is relevant or how to break it. Just, &ldquo;everyone knows it&rsquo;s bad.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The reason why ECB mode of any block cipher is bad is that the same input always encrypts to the same output. The input is broken into fixed-length blocks and encrypted, and all of the blocks of identical input will create similarly equal output blocks. The data is all encrypted, but we know where their plaintexts were the same. There is <em>no key recovery attack against this issue</em>, at least not that I am aware of, but the problem is that the plaintext can be guessed. There are two basic attacks against ECB:</p>

<ol>
<li>Given enough encrypted blocks and some partial knowledge of the plaintext (known offsets of fixed data, like as defined by filetype formats or communication protocols), statistical and frequency analysis (and some guessing, then confirming) can reveal partial plaintext.</li>
<li>Given the ability to prefix or circumfix (that means insert in the middle somewhere) arbitrary plaintext, and then have it encrypted and view the resulting ciphertext, an attacker can stage what cryptographers call a Chosen Plaintext Attack (CPA). The scenario of passing arbitrary plaintext to a remote encryptor and receiving the ciphertext back is also called an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_machine#Applications_to_cryptography">Oracle</a>. This is the attack we will discuss in this post.</li>
</ol>

<p>The reason why this is <em>relevant</em> is that to the average programmer who can&rsquo;t be bothered, ECB looks like a valid mode choice for AES, a cipher that people generally recommend: &ldquo;military grade crypto,&rdquo; right? They might use it to encrypt the cookie their web site stores in your browser. Or if they&rsquo;re especially ignorant in security like the people who work at Adobe, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2013/11/how-an-epic-blunder-by-adobe-could-strengthen-hand-of-password-crackers/">they might use it to encrypt their users&rsquo; passwords on the server</a>.</p>

<h2 id="breaking-ecb-with-the-chosen-plaintext-attack">Breaking ECB with the Chosen Plaintext Attack</h2>

<p>Being able to circumfix our arbitrary input into the plaintext (at a known location in that string) means that we can choose an input such that we can fully align <em>our</em> <em>known</em> <em>substring</em> on an AES block boundary. Thus allowing us to test what the ciphertext is for any arbitrary block that we choose.</p>

<pre><code>&quot;agent &quot; + yourinput + &quot; wants to see &quot; + flag + padding
(6 chars)  (n chars)    (14 chars)   &lt;—- if you want to test-encrypt a single block of arbitrary input, put your test input on a 16-byte block boundary, like so: yourinput = &quot;01234567891000000000000000&quot;. &quot;1000000000000000&quot; is at bytes 16 through 31 of the input, aka the second AES (128-bit, 16-byte) block.
</code></pre>

<p>We don&rsquo;t know how long the flag is, but we know how the padding is applied: if the plaintext message does not end on a 16-byte boundary, then it is extended by a single &ldquo;1&rdquo; and up to 14 &ldquo;0&rdquo; characters. If the plaintext message <em>does</em> end on a 16-byte boundary, then it is extended by a full block of padding: <code>1000000000000000</code>. This may seem counter-intuitive, but there always has to be padding in a block cipher, even when the message length already is a multiple of the block length: otherwise how would you know if the last block is padding or if <code>1000000000000000</code> was part of the message?</p>

<p>See where we&rsquo;re going with this? We will give the above plaintext, and observe the output&rsquo;s 2nd block. That is the exact same output we would expect to see as the last block of ciphertext if the flag ends at a block boundary and the final block were AES padding.</p>

<pre><code>Agent number: 01234567891000000000000000
ceaa6fa24a71971f21413c1ea39f4e7c53b1c1d36d11a2c20dfc3913bb299f11c9777890922460e74fefb1a94f5c95df0ebb6d7bc5a7922f0857283feb2b068dc5148be36b7670e2ca4fe52c3f65c37612b88acbe4bbd5a9f2588bbc4e0ea92453b1c1d36d11a2c20dfc3913bb299f11
</code></pre>

<p>Note the second block (32 hex characters = 16 bytes) of ciphertext is <code>53b1c1d36d11a2c20dfc3913bb299f11c</code> and, through a stroke of luck, we&rsquo;ve already aligned the overall message on a block boundary too, as we see <code>53b1c1d36d11a2c20dfc3913bb299f11c</code> is also the last block of ciphertext!</p>

<p>The game now is to insert one <em>additional</em> byte of arbitray text in order to push a single byte of the &ldquo;flag&rdquo; portion of the string rightward into the padding block. The final padding block will be <code>n100000000000000</code> where <code>n</code> is the unknown byte of flag.</p>

<p>What will we do then to guess that byte? We&rsquo;ll brute-force it: send new plaintext messages for all 255 possibilities of <code>n</code> in our block-aligned arbitrary input (which is the 2nd block). When the ciphertext&rsquo;s 2nd block matches the ciphertext&rsquo;s 7th block, then we know we guessed correctly. Then we&rsquo;ll insert one additional byte again at the same location, and repeat this process. In other words, we expect to send a series of messages like the following:</p>

<pre><code>0123456789a100000000000000
0123456789b100000000000000
0123456789c100000000000000
0123456789d100000000000000
0123456789e100000000000000 ... let's say that ciphertext blocks 2 and 7 match at this point!
0123456789ae10000000000000
0123456789be10000000000000
0123456789ce10000000000000
0123456789de10000000000000
0123456789ee10000000000000
0123456789fe10000000000000 ... they match again. We so far know last block = fe10000000000000
0123456789afe1000000000000
0123456789bfe1000000000000
and so on, and so on... up to 255 guesses per byte and as many bytes as we need to discover
</code></pre>

<p>In practical terms, we can try guessing only in the ASCII range of 0x20-0x7E or so, since we expect the secret in this case to be plaintext (the &ldquo;flag&rdquo;). This will speed things up by more than double.</p>

<h2 id="what-it-is">What it Is</h2>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">Markdown</a> is a <em>lightweight markup language</em> (as opposed to a <strong>heavyweight</strong> one like HTML or LaTeX). If you&rsquo;ve ever taken plain-text file notes and used an asterisk to represent a bullet point, or a line of dashes like an underline for a heading, then you&rsquo;ve basically already written Markdown. Markdown is a natural-looking &ldquo;syntax&rdquo; that lets you turn text like this:</p>

<pre><code>## What it is
[Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) is a *lightweight markup language* (as opposed to a **heavyweight** one like HTML or LaTeX).
</code></pre>

<p>into the HTML+CSS page that you&rsquo;re looking at right now. We&rsquo;ve all known that annoying nerd who refuses to send HTML-formatted emails and insists on sending plain text peppered with slashes and asterisks instead of italics and bold? Yea, basically a guy like that turned it into a semi-official standard, and now instead of being imaginary italics and bold, it actually renders that way.</p>

<h2 id="why-not-just-write-in-html-directly">Why Not Just Write in HTML Directly?</h2>

<p>I think this is <a href="http://brettterpstra.com/2011/08/31/why-markdown-a-two-minute-explanation/">best explained by Brett Terpstra here</a>. Basically, HTML sucks to work in, if you&rsquo;re just trying to write some content. HTML is tedious, hard on the eyes, and error prone. If you want a site to look good at all, it also needs CSS, and that sucks even worse. Real people don&rsquo;t want to work in either one, they just want to write prose and have it look good. For this, you can use Markdown as a standard format for your thoughts, and then let a static site generator (like Hugo) turn it into a web page. Be a writer, not a website developer, is the thinking.</p>

<h2 id="editors">Editors</h2>

<p>I went looking for the ideal text editor in which to edit Markdown files. Ideally I could find something that ran on both MacOS and Linux, just for consistency since I use both. But Markdown is a standard format so I would also settle for the best on each respective platform, even if I had to use two different editors.</p>

<p>If there is one thing that gets reinvented most often, it&rsquo;s text editors. Programmers love to re-solve their own nerd problems rather than tackle real-world problems, and one problem every programmer has is editing text. So there are about 500 choices of text editor at this point, but I narrowed it down to these 7 just on the basis of using them to edit Markdown.</p>

<p><img src="img/markdownEditors.png" alt="MarkdownEditors" /></p>

<p>If the job is programming, a text editor should have code-completion and syntax highlighting. But if the job is editing a markup language, WYSIWYG is the number one thing I care about. So you notice I am not even considering the Vims and Emacs of the world. The whole point of Markdown was to be easy: easy for a human to read in its raw state, easy to edit. But I guess I would take this sentiment a little bit further: why should I have to look at markup language at all? It&rsquo;s 2017, shouldn&rsquo;t I have an editor at least as good as WordPad from Windows 95? Of course, I want it to be able to flip back to the raw &ldquo;source&rdquo; markup when necessary, but most of the time I just want to edit it the way it&rsquo;s going to look when I&rsquo;m done.</p>

<p>This is a surprisingly uncommon feature. It seems that most editors have adopted the two-view or split-window paradigm seen in editors for more complicated markup and typesetting languages like LaTeX. They present the raw Markdown source on the left, and the rendered version on the right. Booooo. The concept of Auto-save, on the other hand, is a ubiquitous feature nowadays. That&rsquo;s great to see.</p>

<p>* = TextNut can open and edit a .md file, but the WYSIWYG aspect only works when it is &ldquo;imported&rdquo; to the proprietary format and edited there, then exported back to Markdown. Quiver has similar focus on Notes and a similar weakness in working in .md directly: basically it&rsquo;s a less capable TextNut.</p>

<p>I like <a href="http://www.texts.io">Texts</a>, but it breaks the &ldquo;front matter&rdquo; on a Hugo post, so that&rsquo;s a deal-breaker. <a href="http://pad.haroopress.com">HarooPad</a>, besides having a lack of  documentation in English and development that has been dead for a couple of years, is pretty robust. If it could only offer WYSIWYG editing I think it would have been my choice.</p>

<p>So the overall winner for me is <a href="https://typora.io">Typora</a>. Eventually it will leave beta, and they&rsquo;ll charge for it, but hopefully it&rsquo;s something reasonable. Until then, it&rsquo;s free!</p>

<h2 id="quicklook-for-md-files-macos">QuickLook for .md Files (MacOS)</h2>

<p>I am all about using QuickLook in MacOS. You just hit space bar on a file in Finder and you get a perfectly good read-only peek at the file. But it doesn&rsquo;t handle Markdown (as plain text, let alone as a rendered view). Fortunately <a href="https://github.com/toland/qlmarkdown/releases">someone made a QuickLook generator</a> you can install using Homebrew: <code>brew install Caskroom/cask/qlmarkdown</code>.</p>

<p>Now you&rsquo;re ready to work with Markdown files!</p>

<h2 id="it-s-not-all-roses-though-behind-the-scenes-on-this-post">It&rsquo;s Not All Roses Though: Behind the Scenes on This Post</h2>

<p>The rendering of your content doesn&rsquo;t <em>always</em> turn out the way you envisioned. When this happens, it&rsquo;s either your Hugo theme, or the Markdown renderer that is to blame. Unfortunately, this might mean rolling up your sleeves and fixing CSS, as I had to do in order to get the table above to look decent. Hopefully this is a one-time thing. I had to go into the purehugo theme subdirectory, and edit <code>static/all.min.css</code> within that.</p>

<p>Secondly, when editing Markdown to embed an image from a local directory (as I&rsquo;ve done above), Hugo requires you to put the files in <code>/static</code> and then in the Markdown you specify a relative path <em>without</em> a leading slash, such as <code>![MarkdownEditors](img/markdownEditors.png)</code> (actual path of the image in the source tree is <code>/blog/static/img/markdownEditors.png</code>) and Hugo will copy it to the publishdir during rendering. Because of this, you can&rsquo;t actually see the image in your Markdown editor, which sucks, and your source tree will have two copies of the file, which also sucks.</p>

<h2 id="hugo-a-static-site-generator">Hugo, a Static Site Generator</h2>

<p>In my last post, I covered the rationale behind using a static site generator. Static site generators are not just for creating blogs. They can also be used to create online resumes, company sites, online documentation, etc.</p>

<p>The default choice for static site generator is Jekyll, which has the most support, but it&rsquo;s troublesome to install and use. Hugo is a popular alternative that is easier to install, and faster to work with. It&rsquo;s implemented in Golang, a.k.a. Go. This means it is written in a statically compiled language (The Best Kind) and is <em>completely dependency free.</em> Dependency hell is the bane of my existence. It&rsquo;s like work that you have to do before you can start working. Anyway, let&rsquo;s look at how to get started.</p>

<h2 id="hugo-install-process-macos">Hugo Install Process (MacOS)</h2>

<p>This is so simple, and its simplicity is the reason why I went with Hugo after trying the more popular Jekyll, which was a mess.</p>

<pre><code class="language-sh">brew update &amp;&amp; brew install hugo
hugo new site myBlog
cd myBlog
git clone https://github.com/dplesca/purehugo.git themes/purehugo
echo &quot;theme = purehugo&quot; &gt;&gt; config.toml 
</code></pre>

<p>Creating or customizing themes is beyond the scope of this post, but what we are doing here is &ldquo;installing&rdquo; a pre-baked Hugo theme, and then setting it as our default.</p>

<h2 id="hugo-workflow-drafting-publishing-a-post-macos">Hugo Workflow: Drafting &amp; Publishing a Post (MacOS)</h2>

<p>In order to create a new post for your blog:</p>

<pre><code class="language-sh">cd myBlog
hugo new post/myReviewOfHugo.md
open content/post/myReviewOfHugo.md # write the post in your text editor

# Optional: launch a local webserver, give it a sec, and preview the blog
hugo server &amp; sleep 2 &amp;&amp; open http://localhost:1313/blog/
killall hugo # because we left hugo running in the background there
</code></pre>

<p>While the server is running, you can actually continue to edit the post in your editor. The server will live update the view in your browser. This is optional, but it will verify that everything will look correct when you publish.</p>

<p>When you&rsquo;re satisfied, you can generate the actual web content to disk, and publish it. The following steps assume you are using Github Pages, so the publish is made using a <code>git</code> push.</p>

<pre><code class="language-sh"># You must already have a GitHub project, and in its settings page, and have set the GitHub pages to &quot;master branch / docs&quot;. In this example, the project name is &quot;blog&quot;.

# These are the one-time Hugo steps:
echo &quot;publishDir = docs&quot; &gt;&gt; config.toml
echo &quot;baseURL = https://myname.github.com/blog&quot; &gt;&gt; config.toml

# These are the one-time Git steps:
rm -rf themes/.git # delete existing git files so they don't interfere
git init  # turn this directory into a git repo
git remote add origin https://github.com/myname/blog.git

# These are the only steps needed every time you publish new content:
hugo  # this generates HTML + JS + CSS under the publishdir (blog/docs/)
git add -A
git commit -m &quot;Add a blog post about whatever.&quot;
git push
</code></pre>

<p>That&rsquo;s all there is to it, although you can always use a different Git client if you don&rsquo;t like the command line. I sure as hell don&rsquo;t like it (I use Atlassian Sourcetree) but it&rsquo;s up to you.</p>

<h2 id="post-metadata-wtf-is-front-matter">Post Metadata: WTF is &ldquo;Front Matter&rdquo; ?</h2>

<p>In each post (each Markdown file), there is some metadata in a header at the top of the file, called &ldquo;front matter.&rdquo; Jekyll was the first to introduce this concept (in name, at least), but it is common across other static generators now. Hugo lets you write front matter in YAML, JSON or TOML (the default). If you&rsquo;ve worked in web development surely you&rsquo;ve heard of JSON, but now you may be asking WTF is YAML and TOML?</p>

<p>These are syntaxes invented specifically for controlling the settings of static site generators. It seems to be a case of &ldquo;reinventing the wheel&rdquo; of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INI_file">INI files</a>, which have been around for decades. Basically, a config file. Key-value pairs. Associative array. Hash table (please don&rsquo;t shorten it to just &ldquo;hash,&rdquo; words have meanings, know the difference). Dictionary. They&rsquo;re all basically the same thing. YAML started in 2009 or so, as a minimalist-syntax alternative to JSON, which itself was a minimalist alternative to XML. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_data_serialization_formats">We&rsquo;ll get this right some day</a>.</p>

<p>The CEO of GitHub and inventor of Jekyll, probably high on the smell of his own farts, in 2013 decided that YAML needed to be even more minimal, and renamed this idea after himself (&ldquo;TOM&rdquo;), and thus was born TOML, which primarily because of the fame of the creator has now spread <a href="https://github.com/toml-lang/toml#projects-using-toml">to a few other projects</a>. Thus, we have minimalized almost all the way back to INI files (except now it has been &ldquo;standardized&rdquo;). Progress.</p>

<p>Oh and by the way, none of these <em>are actually markup languages at all</em>. They just aren&rsquo;t. The insistence on propagating the use of the acronym letters -ML for config file formats is basically an inside joke at this point.</p>

<p>The takeaway for me is that in the mid-2000s it became fashionable to ditch braces and brackets in all syntax for everything, in favor of careful indentation. Thus returning to the fashion of the 1970s and FORTRAN. You know what&rsquo;s popular <em>today</em>, though? Look at Go, Rust, and Swift. Yea that&rsquo;s right, compiled languages with curly braces are back again. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sX0CbA4718A">Urge to kill risinnnnnnng.</a> All right, deep breaths.</p>

<p>Anyway, within this &ldquo;front matter,&rdquo; you can define tags and categories, timestamps, and titles for every post. For examplte, the front matter for this post was defined as such:</p>

<pre><code class="language-toml">+++
Tags = [&quot;web&quot;,&quot;blogging&quot;,&quot;Hugo&quot;, &quot;Jekyll&quot;, &quot;YAML&quot;, &quot;TOML&quot;]
Description = &quot;Initial impressions on the static site generator, Hugo&quot;
date = &quot;2017-02-03T19:07:12-05:00&quot;
title = &quot;Hugo, the static site generator&quot;
Categories = [&quot;web&quot;,&quot;blogging&quot;,&quot;Hugo&quot;]
+++
</code></pre>

<p>You can also set optional variables like a publish date in the future (Hugo will not render it to the content directory until this date), or an alias (if you want to forward visitors from another URL to this post instead).</p>

<p>The configuration file for your Hugo site, <code>config.toml</code>, is also in this syntax.</p>

<p>That more or less covers the basics of Hugo, and static site generators like it. My next post will be about Markdown (an <em>actual</em> markup language).</p>

                    <div class="post-description">
                        <p>My first blog, back in the early 2000s, was on a hosted blogging platform known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blogger_(service)">Blogger</a>. It was simple and convenient: as the admin you just logged into the Blogger service, edited posts in your browser, and hit publish. This is basically how Tumblr still works today, although Tumblr&rsquo;s innovation was to include media file hosting and allow everyone to repost each others&rsquo; content.</p>

<p>But Blogger content was <em>static</em>, and textual. You could post a few paragraphs of text, and embed images if they were hosted elsewhere. Only later did Google buy out the service and integrate it with their photo-hosting service. In the mid-2000s, many geeks wanted more flexibility, like the ability to limit access to members only, integrate their own photo/video/audio collections, and – most importantly – control the appearance of their blog.</p>

<p>So my second blog was generated with a Web Content Management System (CMS) and self-hosted on a home Windows XP PC running the &ldquo;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP_%28software_bundle%29#WAMP">WAMP</a>&rdquo; software stack, with a DNS record from a free dynamic DNS service. If you&rsquo;re a system admin or security expert you&rsquo;re probably cringing. I am too. In hindsight, it&rsquo;s a miracle if that PC was not 0wned by a hacker at some point, but at least I have no evidence to believe it was. But I thought my blog was pretty cool, it had a custom look, custom domain name, its own forums, file storage, a weather widget on the sidebar. I believe it was using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drupal">Drupal CMS</a>. The 2000s saw this rise of the &ldquo;web app,&rdquo; a concept that an application was something that ran in a scripting language on a web server and presented you with a web page as the user interface. As a system programmer who thinks an application is a single self-contained compiled binary, I thought this was an anathema. But the rest of the tech world decided otherwise: websites that were not database-backed and server-side-scripted were totally 90s! That meant lame. 90s wasn&rsquo;t cool again yet.</p>

<p>The reason why the self-hosted CMS approach to blogging is cringey is that it is notoriously difficult to secure a CMS, especially one written in PHP. PHP is now known to be prone to reoccuring security issues because of flaws in its design (unvalidated input, access control problems, command injection issues, etc.), and the use of a SQL database means fighting a war agains SQL injection attacks from anyone who uses your site. Spammers will leave spam comments. You just want to run a blog, but now you&rsquo;re a system admin for a web server, a database admin for a database, and you have to understand the PHP (or Java, or whatever) that generates your site on the fly every time a visitor loads a page. If you ever want to use a web hosting service for your CMS-based site instead of hosting it at home, you have to pay real money, because supporting and securing Apache, PHP, and MySQL is a full-time job! On top of all of that, all of this script and database stuff makes the site is slower to load, and prone to Denial of Service attacks.</p>

<p>This is no way to live. And so, as is typical, the tech community decided that what is old is new again, and that static sites were actually a good idea that should never have been abandoned. Rolling my eyes so hard I went temporarily blind, I actually resisted even caring about the cool way to blog in the 2010s. I used LiveJournal for a bit. I tried a hosted Wordpress (Wordpress.com) account to blog about game console emulators. I got into using Tumblr, even though (or maybe <em>because</em>) the tech community is not on there. But now I&rsquo;ve decided to give a fresh look at what&rsquo;s fresh, and give it a chance.</p>

<p>Here are some things I noticed about the current Preferred Way for Cool Kids to Blog.</p>

<ul>
<li>If you write any kind of code for a living, you host it on a free hosting service in the .io TLD. This is just what is fashionable, and like all fashion choices, it can&rsquo;t really be explained. &ldquo;Everyone is doing it&rdquo;, including this blog. We are not all hosting sites in the British Indian Ocean Territory, but yes, this TLD exists because the UK <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depopulation_of_Chagossians_from_the_Chagos_Archipelago">stole some Pacific Islanders&rsquo; land</a> during the Cold War, and its only other claim to fame might be <a href="http://content.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1828469,00.html">its black site CIA torture prison</a>. How&rsquo;s that for oblivious Silicon Valley tech privilege!</li>
<li>Because HTML, JS, and CSS are nearly impossible to work in directly anymore (much like assembly code), people write their web page content in a highly simplified markup language, and then run <em>that</em> through a compiler (oh, sorry, <em>static site generator</em>) to produce a web site in actual HTML, JS, and CSS. The output is then posted to a web hosting service. There are some <a href="https://staticsitegenerators.net">450 static site generators</a> to choose from. This site uses Hugo, which I&rsquo;ll talk about in a future post. An even more popular choice is Jekyll, which is fine…for me to poop on.</li>
<li>The simplified markup language of choice currently is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">Markdown</a>, which will also be the subject of a future post because it is pretty neat.</li>
<li>Because supporting the ability for visitors to post comments would require a dynamic site, static sites have outsourced this responsibility to third-party services. That is, comments are implemented with an embedded JavaScript element that is loaded from a remote service. The dominant choice of service at the moment is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disqus">Disqus</a>. This and any other user-account-based service that embeds its content on your blog is a privacy problem: it means Disqus is basically assigning you an identifier and following you around to all of the Disqus-enabled sites you visit. <a href="https://www.ghostery.com">Ghostery</a> blocks Disqus by default, for this reason. I suggest using Twitter to reach me if you have a comment.</li>
<li>Because static sites cannot track how many visitors they get and where they visited from, that too has been outsourced. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Analytics">Google Analytics</a> is now more prevalent than HPV and herpes combined. I have had to delete it out of every web-related code repository that I have borrowed to make anything. Even if I&rsquo;m the last one on Earth who cares about privacy, I will not be including that here. The same goes for social media sharing links. You&rsquo;re a big boy and/or girl, I bet you&rsquo;ll figure out how to share a URL yourself!</li>
</ul>

<p>So there you have it, my take on the Way to Blog in the 2010s for Cool Kids. Thanks for reading. – MM</p>
