      <description>As mentioned in my last post, I spent some time solving security challenges posted on HackCenter for the Enigma2017 conference. This one (obviously) was to exploit a buffer overflow vulnerability. It was meant to be relatively easy, but sometimes you don&amp;rsquo;t realize the easiest approach first. I&amp;rsquo;ll walk through not just the solution, but the things I tried that didn&amp;rsquo;t work. It was a refresher course in exploitation for me â€“ I&amp;rsquo;ve spent many years on defense research and needed to brush up again.</description>

      <description>There is a new &amp;ldquo;Jeopardy style&amp;rdquo; security CTF web framework (CTF-as-a-Service?) called HackCenter that just debuted from For All Secure, the CMU-affiliated security startup known for winning last year&amp;rsquo;s DARPA Cyber Grand Challenge Final Event with their game-playing &amp;ldquo;automated exploit generation&amp;rdquo; system they called Mayhem CRS. HackCenter is their &amp;ldquo;other&amp;rdquo; technology, I guess, and right now the only CTF they&amp;rsquo;ve hosted is/was the one that occurred at Enigma2017 USENIX conference at the end of January.</description>
