      <description>In my last post, I talked about what I think is the significance of the programming language Rust, and why I wanted to try learning it. Today, I take a look at Exercism.io (a sort-of social network for programming exercises) and its series of Rust challenges. These are definitely easy problems (so far); the focus is on learning how to solve them in a language that is new to you.</description>

      <description>Where to Find More Execution Performance Moore&amp;rsquo;s Law is just about done. It once described a trend of transistor count doubling every 24 months (enabled by increasing the density of transistors by making them ever-smaller). Now:
 Between the introduction of 65 nm and 45 nm chips, about 23 months passed. To get from 45 nm to 32 nm took about 27 months, 28 months to go down from there to 22 nm and 30 months to shrink to the current 14 nm process.</description>
